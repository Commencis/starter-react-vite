## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js

Before you begin, ensure you have `node: >= 24.15` installed on your system.

#### pnpm

This project uses `pnpm@10.28.2` as the package manager. You can install it either by activating with `corepack` which is the recommended way:

```bash
corepack prepare pnpm@10.28.2 --activate
corepack enable pnpm
```

or install globally on your system with npm.

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

Run the following command to install project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will launch the development server and you can access your application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Folder Structure

> **Note:** Some libraries and folders, such as MSW, Storybook, Redux, and RTK, can be removed if they are not required for your project. For example, if you are using this template for an onboarding project and do not plan to showcase components or mock API calls, you can safely remove Storybook or MSW.

Refer to the sections below for more details on their locations and use cases.
